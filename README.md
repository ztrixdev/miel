> **🚧 EARLY DEVELOPMENT 🚧:** Miel is in very early development. Syntax can change and documentation is nonexistent. Now is the perfect time to get involved to help Miel stabilize.

A cozy systems programming language.

```haskell
#Import "std/fs.mi"

func Add :: callable(a: int, b: int): int {
    a + b
}

;; permission types help prove secure data access at compile-time
func ReadFileToString :: callable(path: strbuf): strbuf @fs.FsRead {
    ;; read file
}

proc Main :: callable() @Root {
    x := 5                  ;; type inference
    y: int = 10             ;; explicit typing
    z := Add(x, Add(5, y))

    data: box [u8; 1024] = box([0; 1024])
    ;; affine types ensure memory safety
    SomeOperation(data)
    SomeOperation(data)     ;; error: `data` was already moved

    acquire fs.FsRead from Root
    contents = ReadFileToString("config.toml")
    release fs.FsRead       ;; release when not needed
    
    contents = ReadFileToString("config.toml")  ;; error: fs.FsRead is absent
}
```

## Why Miel?

No reason, really. Honestly, just use Rust, Odin or Jai. I made Miel as "the language I'd use."\
Miel wasn't designed to be blazingly fast or revolutionary. Just.. "for me."

You're probably better off with Rust, Odin or Jai.

## Installation

Prerequisites:

- Rust (install through https://rustup.rs)
- Visual Studio Build Tools (for Rust, should be prompted for when installing Rust)
- Git (install through https://git-scm.com)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tayenx3/miel.git
cd miel
cargo build --release
# result should be in ./target/release with the name miel.exe, probably
```

## Philosophy

Miel was created just for the joy of creation (no, not a FNAF reference).
